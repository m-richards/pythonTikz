pythonTikZ
==========
pythonTikZ is a Python library creating TikZ graphics in LaTeX. 
The library began in concept as a fork of PyLaTeX, which still
forms a basis for the package. Its goal is to provide a higher
level interface, less error prone interface to writing TikZ,
whilst still exposing enough low level detail that complex 
diagrams can be produced. 

The library aims to provide a convenient, reusable way
of writing TikZ where documentation and type hinting
are available to aid in this process.

Installation
------------
pythonTikZ works on Python 3.6+
To be completed

Support
-------
This library is developed for use on Windows, but is tested on WSL. 
This should mean the library will work on both Windows and Linux but 
that is not guaranteed.
